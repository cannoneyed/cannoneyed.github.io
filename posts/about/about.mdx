title: about andy coenen

I'm an engineer, inventor, artist and musician working and living in the NYC area. In 2010 I co-founded [The M Machine](https://www.the-m-machine.com), an acclaimed electronic music and media project, and built some [really](/projects/) [cool](/projects/) [things](/projects/). In 2015 I switched my professional focus to software engineering and am currently working as a software engineer at [Google Brain](https://pair.withgoogle.com/), mainly focused on controllability of generative models. In a past life I was a neuroscientist, and I'm still deeply fascinated by biosciences, perception, and artificial intelligence.

I'm obsessed with bleeding edge technology, and am especially interested in generative AI, programming language design, and creative coding.
