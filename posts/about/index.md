title: about andy coenen
---


I'm a programmer, inventor, artist and musician working and living in San Francisco. In 2010 I co-founded [The M Machine](https://www.the-m-machine.com), an acclaimed electronic music and media project, and built some [really](/projects/) [cool](/projects/) [things](/projects/). In 2015 I switched my professional focus to software engineering and am currently working as a software engineer at [Google Brain](https://research.google.com/teams/brain/healthcare/). In a past life I was a neuroscientist, and I'm still deeply fascinated by biosciences, perception, and artificial intelligence.

I'm passionate about bleeding edge technology, and am especially interested in human-machine interaction, programming language design, and creative coding. I believe deeply in building the tools of the future and am inspired by turning imagination into reality.
