But with everyday computing power many orders of magnitude greater today and an almost limitless toolkit available to creative technologists, MIDI’s age is showing more and more. HD video sequencing, realtime 3D composition and rendering, drone control, robotic interfacing, augmented reality, and anything imaginable can be controlled from pretty much anything… But if you want to run these things from a sequencer or most hardware controllers you’ll still have to translate from a MIDI signal - which is limited to 7 bits (0-127) of data and has no semantic metadata.</p>\\n<p>Enter OSC - a protocol first outlined by the CNMAT at UC Berkeley. OSC allows transmission of URL-encoded data at high data and time resolution over UDP (or TCP, with a bit of work). This means that any part of any system can be given a lexical OSC address to receive signals from anywhere else without complex encoding schemes or limits on data resolution, internally or over a network. For example, triggering the first video clip of the first layer in Resolume Avenue is as simple as sending the message <code>/layer1/clip1/connect 1</code> to whatever port Resolume is listening to, rather than a numbered MIDI mapping.</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <img src=\\\"./touch-osc.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\">\\n    <figcaption><a href=\\\"http://hexler.net/software/touchosc\\\" title=\\\"TouchOSC Interface enabling iPad control\\\">TouchOSC Interface enabling iPad control</a>.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>It’s in complex sets of high-resolution data where OSC can really shine - Large banks of lights, incredibly precise inverse kinematic controls for robotics, 3D generative content, or data from human-interfacing devices can all be routed and parsed incredibly quickly and easily - The expressivity and depth and breadth of control that creativity requires is much more readily achieved.</p>\\n<p>In order for OSC to achieve mainstream acceptance, a major change in the toolkits of creative multimedia artists is required. Ableton Live is currently the de facto standard for central dispatching of many multimedia projects, yet currently has no packaged support for OSC. There’s a huge hole in the marketplace waiting to be filled by whatever’s up to the task.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>One of my first big programming projects was a simple OSC audio unit plugin that I worked on before starting all of the precourse work required for Hack Reactor. I used it to great effect to design and produce The M Machine’s video content for their recent tour with The Glitch Mob, to great effect. I was able to control video in Resolume at sub-frame precision from the Logic timeline, and instantiate and modify video effects and real-time generated Quartz Composer content all from the DAW. It’s been an exciting project, and I look forward to releasing a finished version soon.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 417 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"N queens in a tweet\",\"date\":\"01/03/2015\",\"description\":\"A lot of power in a little bit of space\",\"readTime\":\"1 min read\",\"words\":134,\"body\":\"<p>One of the most interesting sprints of the first two weeks at Hack Reactor involved the famous n-queens problem: given a chessboard of size n x n, how many ways can you arrange n queens on the boards such that no queen is threatened by another?</p>\\n<p>My partner <a href=\\\"https://github.com/zdlopez\\\" title=\\\"github\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">Zachary Lopez</a> and I created a few different algorithms to approach this problem, ultimately implementing a bitwise solution described <a href=\\\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.51.7113&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\\\" title=\\\"Backtracking Algorithms in MCPL using Bit Patterns and Recursion\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">here</a>.

This bit of redirection allows us to inject an injector script onto the page, which in turn generates more script tags with a source attribute corresponding to the queried library.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>Console Injector was a great project to learn about Chrome extensions and bring something to life in a short amount of time.

This example represents a single point, but any polygon or shape can be represented.</p>\\n<p>In order to query mongoDB based on geoJSON objects, the data in the database must be indexed geographically.

Since each invocation of the <strong>iterator</strong>’s <code>next</code> method gives us a  <code>Promise</code>, we can devise a way to make the resolution of each <code>Promise</code> trigger the <code>next</code> method, resuming the code inside the <strong>generator</strong> where we left off and giving us access to the next Promise.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">Promise</span> = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'bluebird'</span>)\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> saySomething = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\">(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">what</span>) =&gt;</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">Promise</span>.resolve(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">`hello, <span class=\\\"hljs-subst\\\">${what}</span>`</span>).delay(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1000</span>)\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>* <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">generator</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> message = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">yield</span> saySomething(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'dog'</span>)\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">console</span>.log(message)\\n  message = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">yield</span> saySomething(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'cat'</span>)\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">console</span>.log(message)\\n}\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">runGenerator</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">genFn</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> iterator = genFn()\\n  nextStep()\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">nextStep</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">response</span>) </span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> step = iterator.next(response)\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> promise = step.value\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span> (!step.done) {\\n      promise.then(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">resolution</span> =&gt;</span> {\\n        nextStep(resolution)\\n      })\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nrunGenerator(generator)\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// 1s: hello, dog</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// 2s: hello, cat</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>By wrapping our <strong>generator function</strong> with the helper function <code>runGenerator</code>, we can leverage the ability to exit and re-enter the generator function to elegantly handle asynchronous code with a very straightforward syntax.</p>\\n<p>Our <code>runGenerator</code> helper first creates an <strong>iterator</strong> from our <strong>generator function</strong>, then creates and invokes a function called <code>nextStep</code>. The <code>nextStep</code> function’s job is actually pretty simple, even though it looks complicated - First, call <code>next</code> on the iterator, passing in the appropriate response to be handed back to the <code>yield</code> (The first time we call <code>nextStep</code>, we don’t pass anything in, since we don’t yet have anything to give back to the generator). By calling <code>next</code> on the iterator, code is run inside the <strong>generator</strong> up to the first <code>yield</code> statement, and we receive back a <code>step</code> object with a <code>value</code> property that’s the <strong>Promise</strong> returned by <code>saySomething</code>!</p>\\n<p>This is the key - by adding a <code>.then</code> method to this <strong>Promise</strong>, we can define the behavior for it to perform when it resolves. What we want to do is trigger <code>nextStep</code>, but this time call it with the value resolved by the <strong>Promise</strong> (<code>'hello, dog'</code>). This <code>resolution</code> is then passed into the <code>iterator.next</code> method, which assigns it to the left of the first <code>yield</code> statement and the code restarts inside the <strong>generator</strong> unil the next <code>yield</code> is reached!</p>\\n<p>Notice that we have to check to make sure our <code>step</code> object isn’t done before trying to call <code>next</code> again.</p>\\n<p>Fortunately, <code>bluebird</code> offers a <code>coroutine</code> method for doing just this. In cases where aysnchronous code is too complex to be handled elegantly by normal <strong>Promise</strong>-based methods, <strong>generator functions</strong> invoked by a <strong>coroutine</strong> handler can offer a massive increase in code readability.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">Promise</span> = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'bluebird'</span>)\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> saySomething = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\">(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">what</span>) =&gt;</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">Promise</span>.resolve(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">`hello, <span class=\\\"hljs-subst\\\">${what}</span>`</span>).delay(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1000</span>)\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>* <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">generator</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> message = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">yield</span> saySomething(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'dog'</span>)\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">console</span>.log(message)\\n  message = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">yield</span> saySomething(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'cat'</span>)\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">console</span>.log(message)\\n}\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">Promise</span>.coroutine(generator)()\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// 1s: hello, dog</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// 2s: hello, cat</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><strong>Promises</strong> with <strong>generator functions</strong> offer an elegant solution to the problems caused by complex asynchronous code - We can write code in a way that looks and behaves very much like normal, easy-to-read synchronous code by leveraging the ability to enter and exit the execution flow inside of a <strong>generator</strong>.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 421 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n\t  value: true\n\t});\n\texports.default = BlogIndex;\n\t\n\tvar _react = __webpack_require__(2);\n\t\n\tvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\t\n\tvar _reactHelmet = __webpack_require__(401);\n\t\n\tvar _reactHelmet2 = _interopRequireDefault(_reactHelmet);\n\t\n\tvar _Archive = __webpack_require__(422);\n\t\n\tvar _Archive2 = _interopRequireDefault(_Archive);\n\t\n\tfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ?

Basically, the touchOSC interface had a timeline of one bar divided into 48 keyframes on a timeline (allowing for 16th notes or 12th note triplets). Each keyframe had an array of buttons corresponding to each panel / outline piece. For any given panel / outline, you picked a start color and brightness, end color and brightness, and duration, then assigned it to a panel at a given position on the timeline. I used 16 colors with 8 brightness steps and encoded them into each of the 16 divisions of the 7-bit MIDI value.</p>\\n<pre><code>MIDI velocity |<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">00</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">01</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">02</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">03</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">04</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">05</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">06</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">07</span>|<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">08</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">09</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">10</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">11</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">12</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">13</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">14</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">15</span>|...\\ncolor         |red                    |blue                   |...\\nbrightness    |<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">2</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">3</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">4</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">5</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">6</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">7</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">8</span> |<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">2</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">3</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">4</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">5</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">6</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">7</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">8</span> |...\\n</code></pre>\\n<figure class=\\\"full-width\\\"><img src=\\\"./m-touch-osc.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"custom touchOSC interface for sequencing patterns\\\"><figcaption>custom touchOSC interface for sequencing patterns</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>These three parameters were encoded as three MIDI notes, and touchOSC would “print” these MIDI notes into clips in Ableton using Max for Live.

Also striking is how important one’s innate feeling of physics is to creating audio-visual synchronization - the attack or decay of a light (how quickly it turns on or off), and how well it matches that of the sound it represents, quickly transforms the light into something directly tied into the sound, as if it’s the thing making the sound or vice versa.</p>\\n<p>I’m incredibly proud of my homemade M Machine, and truly loved performing with it.

When all of it was working together, it was a massive scale orchestration of three machines and a multitude of controllers and sequencers generating a highly synchronized and deeply detailed visual performance.</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <video src=\\\"./m-video-wall-04.webm\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" autoplay loop></video>\\n    <figcaption>Austin, TX - 2013</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>One of the most satisfying pieces of switching from the LED to the virtual light wall was the incredible array creative frontiers it opened up. Programming visuals for the LED light wall was truly a unique art form, and I felt as if I had perfected it around my 30th composition - there’s only so many ways to make 32 pixels and 20 channels of LED ribbon look compelling. However the world of video and VFX is almost limitless, and I sampled thousands of videos of countless styles, mixing, mashing, and effecting them in countless ways to create new and interesting visual content for every track that I programmed accompanying visuals. From <strong>Black</strong>, which featured a strobing black, white, and red 3D spider, to <strong>Luma</strong>, which featured beautiful space imagery, the live show never felt stagnant, repetitive, or forced. And I could always invent new interpretations of the original sequenced data - <strong>Deep Search</strong>, for example, featured a minimalistic 3D pure geometric version of the original LED wall sequence that could be bent and distorted in real time with my MIDI controller.</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <img src=\\\"./collage-2.jpg\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" class=\\\"full-width\\\"></img>\\n    <figcaption>Ableton, MAX/MSP, Touch Designer, and Resolume</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p><video src=\\\"./m-video-wall-01.webm\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" autoplay loop></video></p>\\n<p><video src=\\\"./m-video-wall-02.webm\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" autoplay loop></video></p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 427 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"The M Machine - Generative Visuals\",\"date\":\"01/01/2015\",\"description\":\"generative live concert visuals for The M Machine's 2015 Just Like Tour\",\"thumbnail\":\"thumbnail.jpg\",\"readTime\":\"3 min read\",\"words\":594,\"body\":\"<figure class=\\\"full-width\\\"><img src=\\\"./thumbnail.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></figure>\\n<p>The most consistent challenge I’ve encountered in my decade of exploring interactive media has been how to get information from point A to point B in a way that fosters creativity.

But at its core, the signaling architecture most commonly used by these programs remains unchanged since its inception in the 80’s.</p>\\n<p>MIDI is a remarkably robust technology - standardized in 1983, its current ubiquity is testament to that fact. But with everyday computing power many orders of magnitude greater today and an almost limitless toolkit available to creative technologists, MIDI’s age is showing more and more. HD video sequencing, realtime 3D composition and rendering, drone control, robotic interfacing, augmented reality, and anything imaginable can be controlled from pretty much anything… But if you want to run these things from a sequencer or most hardware controllers you’ll still have to translate from a MIDI signal - which is limited to 7 bits (0-127) of data and has no semantic metadata.</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <img src=\\\"./max-ableton.jpg\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" class=\\\"full-width\\\"></img>\\n    <figcaption>Max / MSP patch driving OSC with Ableton</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>Enter OSC - a protocol first outlined by the CNMAT at UC Berkeley. OSC allows transmission of URL-encoded data at high data and time resolution over UDP (or TCP, with a bit of work). This means that any part of any system can be given a lexical OSC address to receive signals from anywhere else without complex encoding schemes or limits on data resolution, internally or over a network. For example, triggering the first video clip of the first layer in Resolume Avenue is as simple as sending the message <code>/layer1/clip1/connect 1</code> to whatever port Resolume is listening to, rather than a numbered MIDI mapping.</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <img src=\\\"./quartz.jpg\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" class=\\\"full-width\\\"></img>\\n    <figcaption>Quartz composer composition for generative visuals</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<hr>\\n<p><video src=\\\"./m-generative-visuals-01.webm\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" autoplay loop class=\\\"glare-thumbnail\\\"></video>\\n<video src=\\\"./m-generative-visuals-02.webm\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" autoplay loop class=\\\"glare-thumbnail\\\"></video></p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>It’s in complex sets of high-resolution data where OSC can really shine - Large banks of lights, incredibly precise inverse kinematic controls for robotics, 3D generative content, or data from human-interfacing devices can all be routed and parsed incredibly quickly and easily - The expressivity and depth and breadth of control that creativity requires is much more readily achieved.</p>\\n<p>In order for OSC to achieve mainstream acceptance, a major change in the toolkits of creative multimedia artists is required. Ableton Live is currently the de facto standard for central dispatching of many multimedia projects, yet currently has no packaged support for OSC.

We’d all spent so many grueling hours laboring over the music on that record, so it was very important that we do something a bit more interesting than the usual social media / blog / spray-and-pray approach for releasing it.</p>\\n<p>The record itself really emphasizes the human side of music - big, monstrous bass drops are replaced with luscious, organic textures and the driving mechanical rhythms of our earlier techno music was replaced with a lighter and more personal touch. This was all very deliberate - we’d been growing more and more disenchanted with the contemporary EDM machine when we wrote the bulk of the music, and were really longing for the music we grew up with - emotional,  full of narrative and meaning, and most importantly - personal.</p>\\n<p>We were immediately struck by the idea of sharing music in person - remembering what it was like to get a burned copy of a CD from a friend, and how it felt so much more special to get new music then.

A chaotic smear of colors, somehow given order and form by the large tear running through the center.</p>\\n<p>I was instantly captivated by the image, and soon realized that there was an extremely interesting story surrounding the piece and the artist behind its conception. <a href=\\\"https://www.danelzik.eu/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">Reinhard Danelzik</a> is a german artist who, after being inspired by Stephen Wolfram’s <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, spent months searching automata in Mathematica before finding the piece.

Electronic music, in particular, is so dependent on the balance between sounds that an artist’s sonic palette and array of tricks often become closely-guarded secrets. One of the true joys of the open-source software community is the inspiration provided from looking “under the hood” of exciting projects, and I really wanted this album to be released in a similar fashion. I want to let people see the decomposed form of the album, and contrast it with the final composition.</p>\\n<p>This sentiment tied in extremely well to the art itself - the tension between form and formlessness, and the apparent structure coming from the breaks in the structure - it really resonated with the feelings I had about the project. However, it took a conversation about these themes with my colleague <a href=\\\"https://github.com/lucaswadedavis\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">Luke Davis</a> to inspire the final project. Luke pointed out that my album had 14 songs, and the piece had 14 colors, and I was immediately inspired.</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <img src=\\\"./zoom.gif\\\"></img>\\n</figure>\\n<p>Each of the 14 colors of pixels would correspond to a song on my album, and each of the 36,570  pixels would correspond with a deconstructed piece of the album.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"a-giant-number\\\"><a class=\\\"header-anchor\\\" href=\\\"#a-giant-number\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">§</a> / a giant number</h2>\\n<p>I’d just done a big dive into Three.js and webGL for my previous project with The M Machine (<a href=\\\"https://www.glare.fm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">glare dot fm</a>), and knew that I wanted to animate the pixels as I interacted with the scene. I’d had a pretty good experience creating a “hybrid” React and Three.js app for that project, and decided to use the same overall approach, swapping out redux for a mobx state management solution. The boundary between declarative react code and imperative three code is always a bit tricky, and mobx’s classic object-oriented approach is much better suited to sharing state across that border.</p>\\n<p>Computing the cellular automaton on the fly in JavaScript was always a stretch goal, but in order to get working on the project more quickly I opted to precompute the image data in Mathematica.

As a “shortcut”, I simply piped the output of the code run in Mathematica and created a JSON file with each pixel mapped to its corresponding hex character code.</p>\\n<p>Once the data was encoded as JSON, it was just a matter of importing it into the webpack bundle and initializing the webGL scene with the pixel data.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"some-shader-funniness\\\"><a class=\\\"header-anchor\\\" href=\\\"#some-shader-funniness\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">§</a> / some shader funniness</h2>\\n<p>My next step was to render the pixels from the CA and set up some interactivity in the scene. The concept was simple - clicking on any of the pixels would zoom into the pixel, where an audio player for the corresponding sound would appear. My initial strategy for setting up the scene was to use a simple Three.js particle shader, with each pixel of the art represented by a simple square particle. Setting up a simple raycaster to handle clicking on the pixels and some simple zoom tween logic, everything looked great…</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <video src=\\\"./zoom.webm\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" autoplay loop class=\\\"glare-thumbnail\\\"></video>\\n    <figcaption>The zoom effect (with the happy accident of \\\"pulling apart\\\")</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>…until it didn’t. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that past a certain zoom level, the simple square particles i was using to represent the pixels stopped growing, creating a lovely “pulling apart” effect when zoomed in close enough. This pleasant surprise quickly turned into an interesting challenge, since this effect turned out to be different across different screen resolutions and GPUs.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"to-be-continued\\\"><a class=\\\"header-anchor\\\" href=\\\"#to-be-continued\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">§</a> / to be continued…</h2>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 431 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n\t  value: true\n\t});\n\texports.default = BlogIndex;\n\t\n\tvar _react = __webpack_require__(2);\n\t\n\tvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\t\n\tvar _reactHelmet = __webpack_require__(401);\n\t\n\tvar _reactHelmet2 = _interopRequireDefault(_reactHelmet);\n\t\n\tvar _Projects = __webpack_require__(432);\n\t\n\tvar _Projects2 = _interopRequireDefault(_Projects);\n\t\n\tvar _Repositories = __webpack_require__(436);\n\t\n\tvar _Repositories2 = _interopRequireDefault(_Repositories);\n\t\n\tfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ?

Turning a knob and seeing or hearing a program react is amazing, but true expressivity comes from a careful attention to the ‘physics’ of the interaction. Like playing a finely crafted instrument, creativity and expressivity is dependent on the nuance, subtlety, and reactivity provided by great tool design.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>Media artists have been empowered by a relatively recent explosion of creative technologies - Ableton Live revolutionized digital audio performance and, partnered with programs like Max/MSP, Touch Designer, and Resolume Avenue, can serve as a hub for a complete multimedia experience. But at its core, the signaling architecture most commonly used by these programs remains unchanged since its inception in the 80’s.</p>\\n<p>MIDI is a remarkably robust technology - standardized in 1983, its current ubiquity is testament to that fact. But with everyday computing power many orders of magnitude greater today and an almost limitless toolkit available to creative technologists, MIDI’s age is showing more and more. HD video sequencing, realtime 3D composition and rendering, drone control, robotic interfacing, augmented reality, and anything imaginable can be controlled from pretty much anything… But if you want to run these things from a sequencer or most hardware controllers you’ll still have to translate from a MIDI signal - which is limited to 7 bits (0-127) of data and has no semantic metadata.</p>\\n<p>Enter OSC - a protocol first outlined by the CNMAT at UC Berkeley. OSC allows transmission of URL-encoded data at high data and time resolution over UDP (or TCP, with a bit of work). This means that any part of any system can be given a lexical OSC address to receive signals from anywhere else without complex encoding schemes or limits on data resolution, internally or over a network. For example, triggering the first video clip of the first layer in Resolume Avenue is as simple as sending the message <code>/layer1/clip1/connect 1</code> to whatever port Resolume is listening to, rather than a numbered MIDI mapping.</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <img src=\\\"./touch-osc.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\">\\n    <figcaption><a href=\\\"http://hexler.net/software/touchosc\\\" title=\\\"TouchOSC Interface enabling iPad control\\\">TouchOSC Interface enabling iPad control</a>.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>It’s in complex sets of high-resolution data where OSC can really shine - Large banks of lights, incredibly precise inverse kinematic controls for robotics, 3D generative content, or data from human-interfacing devices can all be routed and parsed incredibly quickly and easily - The expressivity and depth and breadth of control that creativity requires is much more readily achieved.</p>\\n<p>In order for OSC to achieve mainstream acceptance, a major change in the toolkits of creative multimedia artists is required. Ableton Live is currently the de facto standard for central dispatching of many multimedia projects, yet currently has no packaged support for OSC. There’s a huge hole in the marketplace waiting to be filled by whatever’s up to the task.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>One of my first big programming projects was a simple OSC audio unit plugin that I worked on before starting all of the precourse work required for Hack Reactor. I used it to great effect to design and produce The M Machine’s video content for their recent tour with The Glitch Mob, to great effect. I was able to control video in Resolume at sub-frame precision from the Logic timeline, and instantiate and modify video effects and real-time generated Quartz Composer content all from the DAW.

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to quickly inject javascript libraries right from the console?</p>\\n<p>My partner during the D3 sprint (<a href=\\\"https://github.com/mmconrad\\\" title=\\\"github\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">Matt Conrad</a>) and I had talked about how cool this would be when we were initially exploring the library. Instead of creating a custom ‘demo’ and manually installing the libraries, it would be very handy to quickly inject a library of choice into any page right from the console and get coding.</p>\\n<p>Enter <a href=\\\"https://github.com/cannoneyed/console-injector\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">Console Injector</a>! The chrome extension creates a console.inject method that can be called to quickly inject any javascript library onto a given page.</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">console</span>.inject(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'jquery'</span>)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The method searches <a href=\\\"https://cdnjs.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">cdnjs</a> for javascript libraries matching a given input string, and inserts the latest corresponding script hosted at <a href=\\\"http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">cdnjs.cloudflare.com</a>. The magic lies in the following snippet of code, which ‘injects’ an injector script into the head of the current document:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> element = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">document</span>.createElement(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'script'</span>);\\nelement.innerHTML = <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'console.inject = '</span> + injectFunction.toString();\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">document</span>.head.appendChild(element);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Since the javascript executed in the chrome extension doesn’t have access to any variables in the current page, in order to modify the console object (which is just another object) we must first append a script to the DOM, which then modifies the console object indirectly. This bit of redirection allows us to inject an injector script onto the page, which in turn generates more script tags with a source attribute corresponding to the queried library.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>Console Injector was a great project to learn about Chrome extensions and bring something to life in a short amount of time.

However mongo offers a number of incredibly powerful query abilities that rely on setting up a more rigid set of indices, including robust geographic search capabilities based on geoJSON.</p>\\n<p>GeoJSON is a format for encoding a variety of geographic features in a specific way.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"type\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Feature\\\"</span>,\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"geometry\\\"</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"type\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Point\\\"</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"coordinates\\\"</span>: [<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">-122.409046</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">37.783748</span>]\\n  },\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"properties\\\"</span>: {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"name\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Hack Reactor\\\"</span>\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The first thing to note is that geoJSON encodes the coordinates of a feature as an array pair of [longitude, latitude], which is the opposite of many popular georgraphic services (like the Google Maps API) which returns latitude / longitude pairs. The second point of interest is that a geoJSON object can contain a variety of geometries. This example represents a single point, but any polygon or shape can be represented.</p>\\n<p>In order to query mongoDB based on geoJSON objects, the data in the database must be indexed geographically. This allows mongo to look up geographic data by a geographic query very efficiently. It’s as simple as setting up an index, which can be done using mongoose:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> mongoose = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'mongoose'</span>);\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> LocationSchema = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> mongoose.Schema({\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">location</span> : {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">type</span>: {\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">type</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">String</span>,\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">default</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Point'</span>\\n    },\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">coordinates</span>: [<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">Number</span>]\\n  }\\n});\\n\\nLocationSchema.index({ <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">location</span> : <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'2dsphere'</span> });\\n\\nLocation = mongoose.model(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Location'</span>, LocationSchema);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This sets up a simple schema of a location object encoded in geoJSON based format.

However, these methods are not part of the es6 standard and require a transpilation step, which is not for everyone.

The question is, can we make <strong>generator functions</strong>  exhibit the same sort of behavior with asynchronous code?</p>\\n<p>It turns out that we can by using a few tricks. <code>bluebird</code>, as usual, offers an excellent implementation, but to better understand how it works and feel even more confident in our understanding, we’ll build our own.</p>\\n<p>Recall that a <strong>generator function</strong> returns an <strong>iterator</strong>, and that this <strong>iterator</strong> is the interface for running the code inside of the generator. Also recall that by invoking the <strong>iterator</strong>’s <code>next</code> method, code inside the generator is executed up to the <code>yield</code> statement, where it ‘pauses’ until the <code>next</code> method is invoked again.</p>\\n<p>Now imagine pairing our asynchronous <code>sayHello</code> function with a <strong>generator function</strong>, like below</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">Promise</span> = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'bluebird'</span>)\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> sayHello = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\">(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">what</span>) =&gt;</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">Promise</span>.resolve(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">`hello, <span class=\\\"hljs-subst\\\">${what}</span>`</span>).delay(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1000</span>)\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>* <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">generator</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">yield</span> sayHello(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'dog'</span>)\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">yield</span> sayHello(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'cat'</span>)\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>If we create an <strong>iterator</strong> and invoke <code>next</code>, it should come as no surprise that the <code>value</code> property of the object returned by calling the <strong>iterator</strong>’s <code>next</code> method is a <strong>Promise</strong>, since that’s what <code>sayHello</code> is returning.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> message\\nmessage = iterator.next().value\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// message = Promise (will eventually resolve 'hello, dog')</span>\\nmessage = iterator.next().value\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// message = Promise (will eventually resolve 'hello, cat')</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This is the secret - Since each invocation of the <strong>iterator</strong>’s <code>next</code> method gives us a  <code>Promise</code>, we can devise a way to make the resolution of each <code>Promise</code> trigger the <code>next</code> method, resuming the code inside the <strong>generator</strong> where we left off and giving us access to the next Promise.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">Promise</span> = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'bluebird'</span>)\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> saySomething = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\">(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">what</span>) =&gt;</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">Promise</span>.resolve(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">`hello, <span class=\\\"hljs-subst\\\">${what}</span>`</span>).delay(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1000</span>)\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>* <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">generator</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> message = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">yield</span> saySomething(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'dog'</span>)\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">console</span>.log(message)\\n  message = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">yield</span> saySomething(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'cat'</span>)\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">console</span>.log(message)\\n}\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">runGenerator</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">genFn</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> iterator = genFn()\\n  nextStep()\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">nextStep</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">response</span>) </span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> step = iterator.next(response)\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> promise = step.value\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span> (!step.done) {\\n      promise.then(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">resolution</span> =&gt;</span> {\\n        nextStep(resolution)\\n      })\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nrunGenerator(generator)\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// 1s: hello, dog</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// 2s: hello, cat</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>By wrapping our <strong>generator function</strong> with the helper function <code>runGenerator</code>, we can leverage the ability to exit and re-enter the generator function to elegantly handle asynchronous code with a very straightforward syntax.</p>\\n<p>Our <code>runGenerator</code> helper first creates an <strong>iterator</strong> from our <strong>generator function</strong>, then creates and invokes a function called <code>nextStep</code>. The <code>nextStep</code> function’s job is actually pretty simple, even though it looks complicated - First, call <code>next</code> on the iterator, passing in the appropriate response to be handed back to the <code>yield</code> (The first time we call <code>nextStep</code>, we don’t pass anything in, since we don’t yet have anything to give back to the generator). By calling <code>next</code> on the iterator, code is run inside the <strong>generator</strong> up to the first <code>yield</code> statement, and we receive back a <code>step</code> object with a <code>value</code> property that’s the <strong>Promise</strong> returned by <code>saySomething</code>!</p>\\n<p>This is the key - by adding a <code>.then</code> method to this <strong>Promise</strong>, we can define the behavior for it to perform when it resolves. What we want to do is trigger <code>nextStep</code>, but this time call it with the value resolved by the <strong>Promise</strong> (<code>'hello, dog'</code>). This <code>resolution</code> is then passed into the <code>iterator.next</code> method, which assigns it to the left of the first <code>yield</code> statement and the code restarts inside the <strong>generator</strong> unil the next <code>yield</code> is reached!</p>\\n<p>Notice that we have to check to make sure our <code>step</code> object isn’t done before trying to call <code>next</code> again.</p>\\n<p>Fortunately, <code>bluebird</code> offers a <code>coroutine</code> method for doing just this. In cases where aysnchronous code is too complex to be handled elegantly by normal <strong>Promise</strong>-based methods, <strong>generator functions</strong> invoked by a <strong>coroutine</strong> handler can offer a massive increase in code readability.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">Promise</span> = <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">require</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'bluebird'</span>)\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> saySomething = <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\">(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">what</span>) =&gt;</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">Promise</span>.resolve(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">`hello, <span class=\\\"hljs-subst\\\">${what}</span>`</span>).delay(<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1000</span>)\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span>* <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">generator</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\"></span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">var</span> message = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">yield</span> saySomething(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'dog'</span>)\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">console</span>.log(message)\\n  message = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">yield</span> saySomething(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'cat'</span>)\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">console</span>.log(message)\\n}\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">Promise</span>.coroutine(generator)()\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// 1s: hello, dog</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// 2s: hello, cat</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><strong>Promises</strong> with <strong>generator functions</strong> offer an elegant solution to the problems caused by complex asynchronous code - We can write code in a way that looks and behaves very much like normal, easy-to-read synchronous code by leveraging the ability to enter and exit the execution flow inside of a <strong>generator</strong>.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ../src/loaders/markdown-loader?{\"config\":{\"blogTitle\":\"cannoneyed\",\"header\":\"cannoneyed.github.io\",\"authorName\":\"Andy Coenen\",\"shortName\":\"cannoneyed\",\"linkPrefix\":\"\",\"domain\":\"https:/cannoneyed.github.io\",\"email\":\"andrew.coenen@gmail.com\",\"description\":\"Andy Coenen - Software developer and artist living and working in San Francisco.\"},\"shouldPrefix\":true}!./blog/2016-01-18-generator-functions-with-promises/index.md","import React, { PropTypes } from 'react';\nimport Helmet from 'react-helmet';\nimport Archive from '../../src/components/Archive';\n\nexport default function BlogIndex({ route }) {\n  return (\n    <section className=\"content\">\n      <Helmet title=\"blog\" />\n      <header>\n        <h2>blog</h2>\n      </header>\n      <Archive route={route} />\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\nBlogIndex.propTypes = {\n  route: PropTypes.object\n};\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./blog/index.js","import React from 'react';\nimport { Link } from 'react-router';\nimport { prefixLink } from 'gatsby-helpers'; // eslint-disable-line\nimport moment from 'moment';\nimport { getBlogPosts } from '../../utils/blog-helpers';\n\nconst generatePostsTable = ({ route }) => {\n  const rows = [];\n  getBlogPosts(route).forEach(({ data, path }) => {\n    const { title, date } = data;\n    rows.push(\n      <tr key={path}>\n        <td><time>{moment(date, 'MM/DD/YYYY').format('YYYY-MM-DD')}</time></td>\n        <td><Link to={prefixLink(path)}>{title}</Link></td>\n      </tr>\n    );\n  });\n  return rows;\n};\n\nexport default function Archive(props) {\n  const rows = generatePostsTable(props);\n  return <table className='post-list'><tbody>{rows}</tbody></table>;\n}\n\nArchive.propTypes = {\n  posts: React.PropTypes.object\n};\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ../src/components/Archive/index.jsx","import React, { PropTypes } from 'react';\n\nimport '../src/css/lists.css';\n\nexport default function SiteIndex() {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <p>\n        <h2>andy coenen</h2>\n      </p>\n      {/* <img alt=\"profile\" src={ image } className={ styles.profileImage } /> */}\n      <p>\n        technologist working and living in San Francisco.

Basically, the touchOSC interface had a timeline of one bar divided into 48 keyframes on a timeline (allowing for 16th notes or 12th note triplets). Each keyframe had an array of buttons corresponding to each panel / outline piece. For any given panel / outline, you picked a start color and brightness, end color and brightness, and duration, then assigned it to a panel at a given position on the timeline. I used 16 colors with 8 brightness steps and encoded them into each of the 16 divisions of the 7-bit MIDI value.</p>\\n<pre><code>MIDI velocity |<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">00</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">01</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">02</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">03</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">04</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">05</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">06</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">07</span>|<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">08</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">09</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">10</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">11</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">12</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">13</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">14</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">15</span>|...\\ncolor         |red                    |blue                   |...\\nbrightness    |<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">2</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">3</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">4</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">5</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">6</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">7</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">8</span> |<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">2</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">3</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">4</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">5</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">6</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">7</span>  <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">8</span> |...\\n</code></pre>\\n<figure class=\\\"full-width\\\"><img src=\\\"./m-touch-osc.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"custom touchOSC interface for sequencing patterns\\\"><figcaption>custom touchOSC interface for sequencing patterns</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>These three parameters were encoded as three MIDI notes, and touchOSC would “print” these MIDI notes into clips in Ableton using Max for Live.

Also striking is how important one’s innate feeling of physics is to creating audio-visual synchronization - the attack or decay of a light (how quickly it turns on or off), and how well it matches that of the sound it represents, quickly transforms the light into something directly tied into the sound, as if it’s the thing making the sound or vice versa.</p>\\n<p>I’m incredibly proud of my homemade M Machine, and truly loved performing with it.

Since TouchDesigner can ingest almost any kind of data, including OSC, we were able to send the same signals that drove the LED sequences of the physical light wall from Max into TouchDesigner, wire them to lights, and create a fully digital working version of our M.</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <img src=\\\"./collage-1.jpg\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" class=\\\"full-width\\\"></img>\\n    <figcaption>Many late nights spent hacking Touch Designer with Phil Reyneri</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>But perhaps the coolest feature of the virtual M was it’s ability to <strong>play</strong> video on the panels themselves. By capturing video off of the GPU using <a href=\\\"http://syphon.v002.info/recorder/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">syphon recorder</a>, we were able to take the output of my <a href=\\\"https://resolume.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">Resolume</a> VJ software and composite it into our TouchDesigner rig to display it in in real time on the face of the M. The live show thus became centered around an idea: The M would display different video content corresponding to each song in the performance. The visual show would consist of zooming into the M until you were immersed in the content, then zooming back out to show the visuals being displayed on the face of the M.</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <video src=\\\"./m-video-wall-05.webm\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" autoplay loop></video>\\n    <figcaption>Sequenced video for Shinichi Osawa's remix of Tiny Anthem</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>Of course, it wasn’t enough to be able to just play video on the virtual M, I had to sequence it and perform with it as well. So I built another OSC-based system for Ableton to sequence video clips and effects and resolume, as well as transitioning between scenes in Touch Designer. When all of it was working together, it was a massive scale orchestration of three machines and a multitude of controllers and sequencers generating a highly synchronized and deeply detailed visual performance.</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <video src=\\\"./m-video-wall-04.webm\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" autoplay loop></video>\\n    <figcaption>Austin, TX - 2013</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>One of the most satisfying pieces of switching from the LED to the virtual light wall was the incredible array creative frontiers it opened up. Programming visuals for the LED light wall was truly a unique art form, and I felt as if I had perfected it around my 30th composition - there’s only so many ways to make 32 pixels and 20 channels of LED ribbon look compelling. However the world of video and VFX is almost limitless, and I sampled thousands of videos of countless styles, mixing, mashing, and effecting them in countless ways to create new and interesting visual content for every track that I programmed accompanying visuals. From <strong>Black</strong>, which featured a strobing black, white, and red 3D spider, to <strong>Luma</strong>, which featured beautiful space imagery, the live show never felt stagnant, repetitive, or forced. And I could always invent new interpretations of the original sequenced data - <strong>Deep Search</strong>, for example, featured a minimalistic 3D pure geometric version of the original LED wall sequence that could be bent and distorted in real time with my MIDI controller.</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <img src=\\\"./collage-2.jpg\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" class=\\\"full-width\\\"></img>\\n    <figcaption>Ableton, MAX/MSP, Touch Designer, and Resolume</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p><video src=\\\"./m-video-wall-01.webm\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" autoplay loop></video></p>\\n<p><video src=\\\"./m-video-wall-02.webm\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" autoplay loop></video></p>\\n\"}\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ../src/loaders/markdown-loader?{\"config\":{\"blogTitle\":\"cannoneyed\",\"header\":\"cannoneyed.github.io\",\"authorName\":\"Andy Coenen\",\"shortName\":\"cannoneyed\",\"linkPrefix\":\"\",\"domain\":\"https:/cannoneyed.github.io\",\"email\":\"andrew.coenen@gmail.com\",\"description\":\"Andy Coenen - Software developer and artist living and working in San Francisco.\"},\"shouldPrefix\":true}!./projects/2014-01-01-the-m-machine-video-wall/index.md","module.exports = {\"title\":\"The M Machine - Generative Visuals\",\"date\":\"01/01/2015\",\"description\":\"generative live concert visuals for The M Machine's 2015 Just Like Tour\",\"thumbnail\":\"thumbnail.jpg\",\"readTime\":\"3 min read\",\"words\":594,\"body\":\"<figure class=\\\"full-width\\\"><img src=\\\"./thumbnail.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></figure>\\n<p>The most consistent challenge I’ve encountered in my decade of exploring interactive media has been how to get information from point A to point B in a way that fosters creativity.

HD video sequencing, realtime 3D composition and rendering, drone control, robotic interfacing, augmented reality, and anything imaginable can be controlled from pretty much anything… But if you want to run these things from a sequencer or most hardware controllers you’ll still have to translate from a MIDI signal - which is limited to 7 bits (0-127) of data and has no semantic metadata.</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <img src=\\\"./max-ableton.jpg\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" class=\\\"full-width\\\"></img>\\n    <figcaption>Max / MSP patch driving OSC with Ableton</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>Enter OSC - a protocol first outlined by the CNMAT at UC Berkeley. OSC allows transmission of URL-encoded data at high data and time resolution over UDP (or TCP, with a bit of work). This means that any part of any system can be given a lexical OSC address to receive signals from anywhere else without complex encoding schemes or limits on data resolution, internally or over a network. For example, triggering the first video clip of the first layer in Resolume Avenue is as simple as sending the message <code>/layer1/clip1/connect 1</code> to whatever port Resolume is listening to, rather than a numbered MIDI mapping.</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <img src=\\\"./quartz.jpg\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" class=\\\"full-width\\\"></img>\\n    <figcaption>Quartz composer composition for generative visuals</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<hr>\\n<p><video src=\\\"./m-generative-visuals-01.webm\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" autoplay loop class=\\\"glare-thumbnail\\\"></video>\\n<video src=\\\"./m-generative-visuals-02.webm\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" autoplay loop class=\\\"glare-thumbnail\\\"></video></p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>It’s in complex sets of high-resolution data where OSC can really shine - Large banks of lights, incredibly precise inverse kinematic controls for robotics, 3D generative content, or data from human-interfacing devices can all be routed and parsed incredibly quickly and easily - The expressivity and depth and breadth of control that creativity requires is much more readily achieved.</p>\\n<p>In order for OSC to achieve mainstream acceptance, a major change in the toolkits of creative multimedia artists is required. Ableton Live is currently the de facto standard for central dispatching of many multimedia projects, yet currently has no packaged support for OSC. There’s a huge hole in the marketplace waiting to be filled by whatever’s up to the task.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p><video src=\\\"./m-generative-visuals-03.webm\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" autoplay loop class=\\\"glare-thumbnail\\\"></video>\\n<video src=\\\"./m-generative-visuals-04.webm\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" autoplay loop class=\\\"glare-thumbnail\\\"></video></p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>One of my first big programming projects was a simple OSC audio unit plugin that I worked on before starting all of the precourse work required for Hack Reactor.

I was able to control video in Resolume at sub-frame precision from the Logic timeline, and instantiate and modify video effects and real-time generated Quartz Composer content all from the DAW. It’s been an exciting project, and I look forward to releasing a finished version soon.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ../src/loaders/markdown-loader?{\"config\":{\"blogTitle\":\"cannoneyed\",\"header\":\"cannoneyed.github.io\",\"authorName\":\"Andy Coenen\",\"shortName\":\"cannoneyed\",\"linkPrefix\":\"\",\"domain\":\"https:/cannoneyed.github.io\",\"email\":\"andrew.coenen@gmail.com\",\"description\":\"Andy Coenen - Software developer and artist living and working in San Francisco.\"},\"shouldPrefix\":true}!./projects/2015-01-01-the-m-machine-quartz/index.md","module.exports = {\"title\":\"holograf\",\"date\":\"01/01/2015\",\"description\":\"3D algorithm and program flow visualizer\",\"thumbnail\":\"thumbnail.jpg\",\"readTime\":\"2 min read\",\"words\":218,\"body\":\"<figure class=\\\"full-width\\\"><img src=\\\"./thumbnail.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></figure>\\n<p>holograf was my thesis project at <a href=\\\"http://www.hackreactor.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">Hack Reactor</a>, which I built with an incredible team (<a href=\\\"https://github.com/lucaswadedavis\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">Luke Davis</a>, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/conrad\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">Matt Conrad</a> and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ryanjlee\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">Ryan Lee</a>).

The full-length album, <a href=\\\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/glare/id1180873312\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">Glare</a>, was the culmination of years of work and was something that I was immensely attached to. We’d all spent so many grueling hours laboring over the music on that record, so it was very important that we do something a bit more interesting than the usual social media / blog / spray-and-pray approach for releasing it.</p>\\n<p>The record itself really emphasizes the human side of music - big, monstrous bass drops are replaced with luscious, organic textures and the driving mechanical rhythms of our earlier techno music was replaced with a lighter and more personal touch. This was all very deliberate - we’d been growing more and more disenchanted with the contemporary EDM machine when we wrote the bulk of the music, and were really longing for the music we grew up with - emotional,  full of narrative and meaning, and most importantly - personal.</p>\\n<p>We were immediately struck by the idea of sharing music in person - remembering what it was like to get a burned copy of a CD from a friend, and how it felt so much more special to get new music then. What if we built a tool where the only way you could get the record was from someone who already had it, in person?</p>\\n<hr>\\n<figure>\\n    <video src=\\\"./glare_interaction_basic.webm\\\" width=\\\"50%\\\" autoplay loop class=\\\"glare-thumbnail\\\"></video>\\n    <figcaption><a href=\\\"http://glare.fm\\\" title=\\\"glare.fm home screen - the album's spread\\\">glare.fm home screen - the album's spread</a>.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>Over the next few months I developed the web app <a href=\\\"https://www.glare.fm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">glare.fm</a>, through which we pre-released the record.

I’ve spent the last two years completing a solo record largely comprised of this music. I tend to think about and write music very visually, both in terms of the physical arrangement of notes and the “physical” texture of the sound. This record is a real distillation of that approach - each song is a world unto itself, a level in a video game, with the timbral and harmonic textures all reinforcing the feeling of some discrete space. I’m calling the record <strong>higher order functions</strong>, and the project <strong>doglogic</strong>.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"a-simple-pattern\\\"><a class=\\\"header-anchor\\\" href=\\\"#a-simple-pattern\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">§</a> / a simple pattern</h2>\\n<p>While writing a good portion of the music in the winter of 2016, my colleague <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/beirnet\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">Thomas Beirne</a> and I were geeking out on cellular automata - simple algorithms that, when applied to pixels in a grid, can generate patterns of striking intricacy and complexity.</p>\\n<p>While digging through forums of the Wolfram Mathematica website (Stephen Wolfram pioneered research into cellular automata throughout his career), I came upon a particularly striking image. A chaotic smear of colors, somehow given order and form by the large tear running through the center.</p>\\n<p>I was instantly captivated by the image, and soon realized that there was an extremely interesting story surrounding the piece and the artist behind its conception. <a href=\\\"https://www.danelzik.eu/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">Reinhard Danelzik</a> is a german artist who, after being inspired by Stephen Wolfram’s <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, spent months searching automata in Mathematica before finding the piece. Reinhard then proceeded to paint each pixel of the composition across 12 panels.</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <img src=\\\"./reinhard.jpg\\\"></img>\\n    <figcaption><a href=\\\"https://www.danelzik.eu/\\\" title=\\\"Reinhard with painting\\\">Reinhard Danelzik with his work</a>.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>I reached out to Reinhard to ask him for his permission to use the piece as my album art, and we quickly became friends. I told him that I wanted to do an interactive piece tying together his art with my music, but it took me months to finally arrive at an idea.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"splitting-the-album\\\"><a class=\\\"header-anchor\\\" href=\\\"#splitting-the-album\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">§</a> / splitting the album</h2>\\n<p>One of the most important goals I had for releasing the album was to make it as “open source” as possible - I want people to be able to look into all of the component pieces that come together to create the cohesive whole. Electronic music, in particular, is so dependent on the balance between sounds that an artist’s sonic palette and array of tricks often become closely-guarded secrets. One of the true joys of the open-source software community is the inspiration provided from looking “under the hood” of exciting projects, and I really wanted this album to be released in a similar fashion. I want to let people see the decomposed form of the album, and contrast it with the final composition.</p>\\n<p>This sentiment tied in extremely well to the art itself - the tension between form and formlessness, and the apparent structure coming from the breaks in the structure - it really resonated with the feelings I had about the project. However, it took a conversation about these themes with my colleague <a href=\\\"https://github.com/lucaswadedavis\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">Luke Davis</a> to inspire the final project. Luke pointed out that my album had 14 songs, and the piece had 14 colors, and I was immediately inspired.</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <img src=\\\"./zoom.gif\\\"></img>\\n</figure>\\n<p>Each of the 14 colors of pixels would correspond to a song on my album, and each of the 36,570  pixels would correspond with a deconstructed piece of the album.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"a-giant-number\\\"><a class=\\\"header-anchor\\\" href=\\\"#a-giant-number\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">§</a> / a giant number</h2>\\n<p>I’d just done a big dive into Three.js and webGL for my previous project with The M Machine (<a href=\\\"https://www.glare.fm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">glare dot fm</a>), and knew that I wanted to animate the pixels as I interacted with the scene. I’d had a pretty good experience creating a “hybrid” React and Three.js app for that project, and decided to use the same overall approach, swapping out redux for a mobx state management solution. The boundary between declarative react code and imperative three code is always a bit tricky, and mobx’s classic object-oriented approach is much better suited to sharing state across that border.</p>\\n<p>Computing the cellular automaton on the fly in JavaScript was always a stretch goal, but in order to get working on the project more quickly I opted to precompute the image data in Mathematica. Here’s Reinhard’s Mathematica code for generating the piece:</p>\\n<pre><code>ArrayPlot[\\n CellularAutomaton[{\\\\\\n<span

As a “shortcut”, I simply piped the output of the code run in Mathematica and created a JSON file with each pixel mapped to its corresponding hex character code.</p>\\n<p>Once the data was encoded as JSON, it was just a matter of importing it into the webpack bundle and initializing the webGL scene with the pixel data.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"some-shader-funniness\\\"><a class=\\\"header-anchor\\\" href=\\\"#some-shader-funniness\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">§</a> / some shader funniness</h2>\\n<p>My next step was to render the pixels from the CA and set up some interactivity in the scene. The concept was simple - clicking on any of the pixels would zoom into the pixel, where an audio player for the corresponding sound would appear. My initial strategy for setting up the scene was to use a simple Three.js particle shader, with each pixel of the art represented by a simple square particle. Setting up a simple raycaster to handle clicking on the pixels and some simple zoom tween logic, everything looked great…</p>\\n<figure>\\n    <video src=\\\"./zoom.webm\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" autoplay loop class=\\\"glare-thumbnail\\\"></video>\\n    <figcaption>The zoom effect (with the happy accident of \\\"pulling apart\\\")</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>…until it didn’t. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that past a certain zoom level, the simple square particles i was using to represent the pixels stopped growing, creating a lovely “pulling apart” effect when zoomed in close enough. This pleasant surprise quickly turned into an interesting challenge, since this effect turned out to be different across different screen resolutions and GPUs.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"to-be-continued\\\"><a class=\\\"header-anchor\\\" href=\\\"#to-be-continued\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">§</a> / to be continued…</h2>\\n\"}\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ../src/loaders/markdown-loader?{\"config\":{\"blogTitle\":\"cannoneyed\",\"header\":\"cannoneyed.github.io\",\"authorName\":\"Andy Coenen\",\"shortName\":\"cannoneyed\",\"linkPrefix\":\"\",\"domain\":\"https:/cannoneyed.github.io\",\"email\":\"andrew.coenen@gmail.com\",\"description\":\"Andy Coenen - Software developer and artist living and working in San Francisco.\"},\"shouldPrefix\":true}!./projects/2017-03-01-dog-logic/index.md","import React, { PropTypes } from 'react';\nimport Helmet from 'react-helmet';\n\nimport Projects from '../../src/components/Projects';\nimport Repositories from '../../src/components/Repositories';\n\nexport default function BlogIndex({ route }) {\n  return (\n    <section className=\"content\">\n      <Helmet title=\"projects\" />\n      <header>\n        <h2>selected projects</h2>\n      </header>\n      <Projects route={route} />\n      <header>\n        <h2>selected repositories</h2>\n      </header>\n      <Repositories />\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\nBlogIndex.propTypes = {\n  route: PropTypes.object\n};\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./projects/index.js","import React from 'react';\nimport { Link } from 'react-router';\nimport { prefixLink } from 'gatsby-helpers';
