I'm a programmer, inventor, artist and musician working and living in San Francisco. In 2010 I co-founded [The M Machine](https://www.the-m-machine.com), an acclaimed electronic music and media project, and built some [really](/projects/) [cool](/projects/) [things](/projects/). In 2015 I switched my professional focus to software development and am currently working as a web engineer at [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com).

I'm passionate about bleeding edge technology, and am especially interested in human-machine interaction, programming language design, and creative coding. I believe deeply in building the tools of the future and am inspired by turning imagination into reality.

▤ node.js | python <br />
▥ react | redux | mobx <br />
▦ mongodb | postgresql | elasticsearch <br />
▧ atom | electron | typescript <br />

**I love to play with:**
