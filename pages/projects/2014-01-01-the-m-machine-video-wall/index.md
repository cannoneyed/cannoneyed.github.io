In early 2013 The M Machine were invited to play at Ultra Music Festival in Miami, and we began the process of designing a new live show complete with an entirely new visual package. While the physical M light wall was a truly impressive stagepiece, it was impractical to tour with, particularly for festival shows where stage transition time is very limited.
