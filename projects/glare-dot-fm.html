<div class="Project_paragraph__8kxkB">In the early parts of 2016 The M Machine and I got together to start brainstorming some new ideas for releasing the body of music that we had written right before I left the group. The full-length album, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/glare/id1180873312">Glare</a>, was the culmination of years of work and was something that I was immensely attached to. We&#x27;d all spent so many grueling hours laboring over the music on that record, so it was very important that we do something a bit more interesting than the usual social media / blog / spray-and-pray approach for releasing it.</div>
<div class="Project_paragraph__8kxkB">The record itself really emphasizes the human side of music - big, monstrous bass drops are replaced with luscious, organic textures and the driving mechanical rhythms of our earlier techno music was replaced with a lighter and more personal touch. This was all very deliberate - we&#x27;d been growing more and more disenchanted with the contemporary EDM machine when we wrote the bulk of the music, and were really longing for the music we grew up with - emotional, full of narrative and meaning, and most importantly - personal.</div>
<div class="Project_paragraph__8kxkB">We were immediately struck by the idea of sharing music in person - remembering what it was like to get a burned copy of a CD from a friend, and how it felt so much more special to get new music then. What if we built a tool where the only way you could get the record was from someone who already had it, in person?</div>

<div class="Project_paragraph__8kxkB">Over the next few months I developed the web app <a href="https://www.glare.fm">glare.fm</a>, through which we pre-released the record. From November 2016 to February 2017 (when the album was officially released through &quot;normal&quot; channels), the album spread across the world, literally from person to person. More than 1000 people from 12 countries listened to Glare before it was released through this deliberately limiting platform.</div>

<div class="Project_paragraph__8kxkB">glare.fm uses a novel geolocation-based mechanism for transferring access to the record from one person to another - At the time I started building the app, I was extremely interested in &quot;serverless&quot; web apps, and elected to build the app using <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">firebase</a> for both its real-time updates and its built-in oauth user authentication. Working with firebase wound up presenting a number of challenges, most of which were caused by the extremely odd way that Google elected to change the firebase client API after their acquisition of the service.</div>
<div class="Project_paragraph__8kxkB">We elected to build a web app, rather than a native app, for a number of reasons - the biggest advantages were rapid iteration with web technologies, no app store review / update process, and the ease of distribution / sharing through a simple url.</div>
<div class="Project_paragraph__8kxkB">glare.fm was a project that quickly grew in scale and ambition, and, as such, presented a number of extremely interesting challenges involved in building a highly-performant media-rich and real-time mobile web application. Some of the highlights include</div>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="Project_paragraph__8kxkB">constructing a mobile touch-responsive webgl globe visualization in three.js (with some cool lens flare effects) to show the spread of the app across the globe, and keep it performant across mobile browsers.</div>
